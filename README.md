# Motion estimation and compensation
## Implementing motion estimation and compensation algorithms
+ Implement full search and three-step search methods to calculate motion vectors and plot the motion vector diagrams
+ Matching criterion: SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences); Block size: 8x8; Search range: [-w, w] (w is a positive integer)
+ Using the motion vectors, implement motion compensation and plot the residual images
